# Minor_Bioinformatics_NGS_Workflows_MvG
These are the Galaxy workflows that were made during the Minor Bioinformatics at Avans University of applied science

During this minor, multiple exercises were made that involve using Galaxy for Bioinformatic analysis. In total, 6 different exercises were made, generating 6 different workflows (although one of these exercises was a continuation from a previous exercise, the pre-existing workflow was copied to make sure that, in the case of any major alterations to the workflow). 
These 6 different exercises were:
1. [A short introduction to Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html)
2. [Optional: NGS data logistics Europe](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-ngs-data-managment/tutorial.html)
3. [Hybrid assembly using Unicycler](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/unicycler-assembly/tutorial.html)
4. [Genome assembly QC](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/assembly-quality-control/tutorial.html)
5. [Antibiotic resisatnce detection on the hybrid assembly](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/plasmid-metagenomics-nanopore/tutorial.html) (the continuation of the assembly from exercise 3)
6. [Pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy - Foodborne Edition](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/microbiome/tutorials/pathogen-detection-from-nanopore-foodborne-data/tutorial.html)

The Galaxy workflows for each of these exercises are found in ....
