# Galaxy exercise 5: Antibiotic resistance detection on the hybrid assembly of exercise 3
This folder contains the .ga file of the workflow itself, as well as an image of the workflow within the Galaxy workflow editor. The image is shown below, as well as in the seperate jpg file
It should be noted that not the entire tutorial was followed, seeing as I already had an assembly from a previous exercise. The tutorial was followed from the point "Species and plasmids"
